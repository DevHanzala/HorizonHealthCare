                               *****Patient Management System******

=>Firstly we created a flow of complete project like UI and pages we needed, with the help of
ShadCn and Tailwind. In the Beginning we take a mock data from gpt to render on the Fronted later on 
we show organic users data....

=>In Components Folders we have a componet <ApplyForm/>. In this component we cretaed a from
which takes complete doctor Info with proper valid data. For Validation we used Zod and for Uploading
Images we used react-dropzone..

=>Then we connect a Mongodb database using mongoose and created a api folders.....
did Authentication using Next/Auth and store all info in the database which is came from our Form.
We did only Google Authentication...   

API Flow: 
..take Api from Frontend and put  object in it then saved the obj and sent Response(POST Req route.js)

Part2 (25min and 31min and 41,42min  1:7min(P3)  to live project)

authjs.dev==>for installing Next Auth(Library for Authentication)
follow each and every step to maintain a heriarchy from website...
for maintaing a session Next Auth created a token. Behind of that token, it has a secret which is 
present in .env 

console.cloud.google.com =>from this all our projects handle even firebase projects also
for taking auth secret we have done all cloud google process 

fot testing API we used Postmen

the purpose of callback which is in auth.js when we login through the google so google redirect it 
but it give some data, so perform task on that data what you want   

First create token then creates session we have recieved session 
if we want anything in session so we can update the token

React form Hook also used in form 
Search params for getting relevant data
every request which user do I can see it in Networks wection in beowser

SearchParams?
